1. Abstract



This project implements an autonomous delivery agent that navigates 2D grid environments using various pathfinding algorithms. The system compares Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search, A* algorithm, Hill Climbing, and Simulated Annealing for optimal path planning under constraints of time, fuel efficiency, and dynamic obstacles.



2. Introduction



2.1 Problem Statement

- Navigate grid environments with static and dynamic obstacles

- Choose optimal paths considering varying terrain costs

- Implement and compare multiple search algorithms

- Handle dynamic replanning when obstacles appear



2.2 Objectives

- Implement uninformed, informed, and local search algorithms

- Develop a robust environment modeling system

- Conduct experimental comparison of algorithm performance

- Demonstrate dynamic obstacle avoidance capabilities

4. Algorithm Implementation

 4.1 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

def bfs_plan(start, goal):
    queue = deque([(start, path=[start])])
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        position, path = queue.popleft()
        if position == goal:
            return path
        for neighbor in get_neighbors(position):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
                visited.add(neighbor)


4.2 A* Algorithm

def a_star_plan(start, goal):
    open_set = PriorityQueue()
    open_set.put((heuristic(start, goal), 0, start, [start]))
    g_costs = {start: 0}
    
    while not open_set.empty():
        f_cost, g_cost, current, path = open_set.get()
        if current == goal:
            return path
        for neighbor, cost in get_neighbors_with_cost(current):
            new_g = g_cost + cost
            if neighbor not in g_costs or new_g < g_costs[neighbor]:
                g_costs[neighbor] = new_g
                f_cost = new_g + heuristic(neighbor, goal)
                open_set.put((f_cost, new_g, neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
